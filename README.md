# Synthetic Data Exercises (Colab / Jupyter Notebook)


> **Instruction summary**
>
> - Use **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook**.
> - Create a synthetic dataset containing some `NaN` values. Set random seed to **42** at the top.
> - Solve four problems (mean/median/weighted mean; z-score outliers; age bins stats; array ops + linear algebra).

## How to run

1. Open Google Colab or a new Jupyter notebook.
2. Follow the steps described in each problem.
3. Execute cells top-to-bottom.

## Problems Overview

### Dataset Creation
- Make a DataFrame with columns: `id`, `age`, `income`, `score`.
- Insert some `NaN` values in `age`, `income`, and `score`.
- Keep the random seed fixed at **42**.

---

### Problem 1 — Mean, Median, Age‑Weighted Mean
- Compute:
  - Mean of income
  - Median of income
  - Age‑weighted mean of income (handle `NaN`s).
- Add a note on when weighted mean is preferable.

---

### Problem 2 — Z‑Score Standardization & Outliers
- Standardize income using z‑score.
- Mark rows where |z| > 3 as outliers.
- Handle `NaN`s correctly (do not drop entire rows).

---

### Problem 3 — Age Bins & Statistics
- Create age bins: `[18‑25)`, `[25‑35)`, `[35‑45)`, `[45‑60)`.
- For each bin compute:
  - Count of observations
  - Mean income
  - Median score
- Present results as a tidy table sorted by bin.

---

### Problem 4 — Array Operations & Linear Algebra
- Make an array (not 1‑D).
- Show:
  - Shape, size, transpose, flatten.
  - Negative indexing and a captured slicing error.
  - Broadcasting and dot product.
  - Determinant and inverse (check for singular matrix).

---

## Final Notes
- Avoid dropping rows wholesale when handling missing data.
- Use `.dropna(subset=[...])` only when specific columns are required.
- Keep `np.random.seed(42)` for reproducibility.
- Document any special handling of weights or missing values.
